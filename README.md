- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rick Lutowski

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m developing an open source CAD tool for modeling the interior arrangement of ships, houses, 
     buildings, space habitats, or other subdivided structures using Java. 
     The program is called Compartmentalized Model (CM) Creator, and can be downloaded from
  github at rlutowski/cmcreator
  
- ðŸ‘€ If you know basic Java and might be interested in collaborating on this tool, you can reach me at
  rick@jreality.com 
  
   Please use the Subject line: "CM Creator"  so your email is not mistaken for spam.

- ðŸ‘€ I look forward to hearing from you.
